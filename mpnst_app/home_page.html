      Other NF1-related tumors such as plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and atypical neurofibromas (AN) are precursors of MPNSTs, and will also be studied in some cases. Paired normal non-tumor specimens (i.e., peripheral blood) will also be studied for comparison. The GeM Consortium has employed a variety of molecular analysis techniques to improve the biological understanding of NF1-related tumors.

The study has utilized multi-omic analysis to better understand the genomic landscape of NF1-related tumors as well as tumors associated with plexiform and atypical neurofibromas. The data resulting from this comprehensive sequencing is displayed throughout the MPNST Surveyor and in the GeM Consortium instance of cBioPortal. For a broad description of the study and the techniques used for analyzing these tumors, please refer to <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/11/4/387">https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/11/4/387</a>.</p>

      Thank you for visiting the MPNST Surveyor. The MPNST Surveyor and The GeM Consortium are the result of an international collaboration to better understand the genomic landscape of MPNSTs and related soft tissue sarcomas. The GeM Consortium is possible in large part due to the commitment of these institutions shown on the right. To learn more about this collaboration, please visit the <a href="https://www.nfresearch-childrens.org/">NF Research Initiative Website</a>. There will be updated information on the progress being made, and you can find out more about the GeM Consortium and the NF Research Initiative.
